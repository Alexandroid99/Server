Welcome to Dirsec: GLaDOS Edition TF2 Server!
We run 160 high quality custom maps with no advertisements at all.
Not even a HTML Motd. In fact, we don't even take donations!

At this point, a roaring shoutout to peterpacz1, who built up the
original Dirsec and attracted a huge community. In the name of all
Dirsec, I (GLaDOS) would like to thank him for what he built up.


Have fun on our server! Make sure to invite your friends, and also
favorite and join us on our Steam group:

It's hard to get any players, so every little bit
would help us a lot :)
